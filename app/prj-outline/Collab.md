**Team’s competencies:**

Most of the team members had experience developing web application in front-end and backend, and worked with web programming languages such as HTML/CSS, Javascript, MongoDB, Json and Node.js. Majority of us have taken CSC309 course, in which we gained reasonable amount of knowledge in web programming, such as knowing how HTTP calls work, different types of web services, servers-side programming using Django and Express, and client-side programming. 
The strength of the team is equally divided: some of members have proficient skills in front-end development and some others in backend development. This allows us to have a balance division of work based on our strengths.

**Team’s constraints:**

Some of the teammates may have heavier course loads then others or may live far from campus to be able to meet up for scrums. Some members of the team mates are of younger academic year, this may lead to different skill sets between teammates. Although there is a standard that the majority have taken the csc309 courses the team does not have the same level of experience with web development; thus pacing of development may be difficult to the more inexperienced users. 

**Meetings so far:**

Regular meetings took place on Friday, from 4 to 5 pm, at HB building. During these on campus meetings, team members discussed about the area of focus that we will work on for the project. Members gave their suggestions and proposed combinations of tasks to be completed that might be well interrelated. In the first meetings, we assigned tasks for coming up with ideas for choosing subset tasks, and discussed the pros and cons of choosing a task. After we have chosen the task, we evaluate our skills to determine if we are able to achieve it. 

**Shared Documents:** 

We used Google documents to collaborate on the project sheet and writing works for P1.
After finished our P1 documents, type it into github.

**Future meetings:** 

Regular meetings will be taken in tutorial rooms, on Friday, 4-5 pm. However, we will consider meeting up after lectures on Monday or Wednesday for a brief scrum. If majority of members are unable to attend, we will host the meetings on a different date. Since schedules for team members may fluctuate, we the schedule will be determined on a weekly basis.

**Division of work:** 

Although group members are divided into sections of work, they are to shift more focus onto their section however ultimately division of work is flexible, everyone on the team is required to do both front end and back end development. They are also responsible for writing test cases

**Backend Developers:** (Ying Yang, Alex Chang, Wang Yiran) The back end developers will be in charge of developing the main functionalities of the application on the **web servers**. They will work on implementing the interactions between the servers and clients such as establish web server using Node.js/Express communication between server and client using HTTP calls(GET, ADD, UPDATE, MODIFY, etc), store user data using MongoDB. 

**Frontend Developers**(Alex Chang, Wang Yiran, Ying Yang): The front end developers will work on the UI layout of the application on **client-side**. They will be working with HTML/CSS, BootStrap and Javascript to create intuitive designs that the end users will be interacting with. They are also in charge of implementing handlers that will record user input and transfer relevant information to the back end for processing. 

**Pull Request Manager**(Wang Yiran): The pull request manager will be in charge of checking for incompatibilities amongst different pull requests. They will communicate with the developers who issued the pull request as needed and make sure that the code is up to date and conflict free.

**Test CI:** (YunZhou Jiang): Set up the Travis CI enviroument for our code testing

**Github collaboration:** Each of us will push to the repo by communicating with each other, especially with the member(s) that are working on similar tasks. We will try to assign to each member independent tasks to minimize the chance of having conflicts. Front-end developers will communicate with each other, similarly for backend developers. Upon each commit to the repo, the member should acknowledge the team to make pull request, especially when at least two members are working at the same time. 

**Messaging:** We will be using Wechat/Facebook as a main form of communication. We will be using Wechat voice for online meetings. Communicating ideas or developments is also more efficient with voice chat rather than text chat.

**Tracking progress:** We will make a complete list of all tasks (in point form) that will be implemented for the project, based on user cases. We will also use Githubs feature of opening tickets to fix any immediate p
