**Overview:**

We will use Travis CI to make the HTTP calls. One member of the team will be responsible to writing the test scripts and setup the environment.

**Web server:**

Since the application will be based on client side and server side requests and response, we will set up some unit tests to test HTTP requests such as HTTP GET, SET, SHOW, ADD. In particular, for testing endpoints, we will be setting up a server connection and populate the database with dummy information and boundary cases. Examples of tests will be testing if HTTP calls work properly. 

**Client Side**: 

For testing client-side code, we will be using jQuery library to handle the DOM manipulation. 
Also need our members test by hand, to check if the UI works as expected.
